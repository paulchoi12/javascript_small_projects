This project took more than it should!! 
The challenge of this project was how to manipulate
html documents and its elements, especially createing
and deleteing.

I have successfully made a todo list that could create
and delete sentences, but the issue is the lack of
being able to save the list into the local storage so
it does not reset when the website is opened again.

next project will be more about linking local storage
to the website so that a program can be used more than once.
